            <p>SMART AGRO provides a range of services aimed at supporting farmers in improving crop productivity and protecting their crops from diseases. Below are the core features of our platform:</p>
            
            <h3>1. Crop Recommendation System</h3>
            <div class="interactive-card">
                <p>Our crop recommendation system leverages weather and soil data to recommend the best crops for a given location. By analyzing factors like soil nutrients (NPK), rainfall, temperature, and humidity, we provide farmers with tailored advice to maximize their yields.</p>
            </div>
            
            <h3>2. Disease Detection</h3>
            <div class="interactive-card">
                <p>We use deep learning techniques to detect diseases in crops. Farmers can upload images of their crops, and our system analyzes the image to identify any diseases. The system then provides treatment recommendations, helping farmers protect their crops early.</p>
            </div>
            
            <h3>3. Data-Driven Insights</h3>
            <div class="interactive-card">
                <p>SMART AGRO gives farmers access to actionable insights based on the latest data analysis and trends. Our platform ensures that farmers can make informed decisions, reduce risks, and optimize crop management practices.</p>

            <h3>Our Future Plans</h3>
            <div class="interactive-card">
                <p>We aim to expand our platform by incorporating more crops, diseases, and geographical areas. Additionally, we will work on integrating IoT sensors for real-time data collection and analysis, bringing even more accuracy to our recommendations.</p>
